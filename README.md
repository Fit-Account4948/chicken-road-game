# Chicken Road 🐔

**Chicken Road** is a fast-paced crash-style arcade game where every move can either increase your multiplier… or turn your chicken into roadkill. Inspired by classic arcade humor and modern crypto game mechanics, it mixes reaction timing, risk control, and a bit of chaos into every round.

## 🎮 What is Chicken Road?

Imagine this: a pixelated chicken on a grid full of danger. With each successful step forward, the potential reward grows — but so does the tension. One wrong move, and your round ends instantly. It's part strategy, part luck, and entirely addictive.

No slot reels, no cards — just one chicken, your decision to move forward (or cash out), and a constantly growing multiplier.
